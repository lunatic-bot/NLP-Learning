1. Difference between Train, Test and Validation
Train - model training - (Train and Validation - Hyper parameter tuning)
Test - model testing (model never sees this)

2. Why people use Random Forest insted of decision Tree
DT usually has - low bias and high varience
To keep this low bias and low varience, we use Random Forest

3. fit, trasnform, fit-transform?
4. fit-predict?
5. Normalization vs standerdization
